## Data Analytics
Data analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover meaningful insights, patterns, and trends. It involves collecting, organizing, and analyzing large volumes of data to extract valuable information and facilitate data-driven decision making. Data analytics encompasses various techniques and tools, including statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning, and data visualization. By applying data analytics, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of their data, identify patterns, make predictions, and derive actionable insights that can drive business growth, optimize processes, and improve overall performance.

# AEMS House Prediction Model - Summer Internship
The AEMS House Prediction Model is a data science project aimed at developing a predictive model for house prices based on data collected from the Advanced Estate Management System (AEMS) database. The model utilizes various features such as house size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes to estimate the price of a house. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, the model aims to provide accurate predictions to assist homeowners, real estate agents, and potential buyers in making informed decisions.

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the readme file for the AEMS House Prediction Model Summer Internship. This internship is focused on developing a data science model that predicts house prices using various features and data collected from the AEMS (Advanced Estate Management System) database. In this document, I will provide an overview of the prerequisites for this project and explain each step followed in detail.

## 2. Prerequisites
To successfully complete this internship, the following prerequisites are required:
- Basic understanding of Python programming language
- Familiarity with data manipulation and analysis libraries such as Pandas and NumPy
- Knowledge of machine learning concepts and libraries such as scikit-learn
- Experience with Jupyter Notebook 

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection
The first step involved collecting data from the AEMS database. The dataset consists of various attributes such as house size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant features.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
In this step, I performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, handling categorical variables, and removing any outliers. Data preprocessing is essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves analyzing the dataset to gain insights and discover patterns. I performed statistical analysis, data visualization, and correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (house price).

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance. I applied techniques such as feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and creating interaction terms to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.

### Step 5: Model Selection
In this step, I explored various machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. I considered models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

### Step 6: Model Training and Evaluation
Once the model was selected, I split the dataset into training and testing sets. I trained the model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Step 7: Model Deployment
After achieving satisfactory model performance, I deployed the model to make predictions on new, unseen data. This involved saving the trained model and developing an interface to accept input features and provide house price predictions.

## 4. Experience
During this summer internship, I had the opportunity to work on a real-world data science project and gain hands-on experience in various aspects of the data science lifecycle. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in Python programming, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

Throughout the internship, I learned the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in improving model performance. I also gained insights into different machine learning algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses.

Working under a  mentor provided me with valuable guidance and feedback. It was a great opportunity to enhance my collaboration and communication skills, as well as learn from industry professional.

Overall, this summer internship was an enriching experience that deepened my understanding of data science and its application in solving real-world problems.
